# CSF Stories with MDX Docs

Storybook’s Component Story Format (CSF) is the recommended way to write stories since Storybook 5.2.

In CSF, stories and component metadata are defined as ES6 modules. Every Component story file consists of a required default export and one or more named exports.

### Default Export

The default export defines metadata about your component, including the component itself, its title (where it will show up in the navigation UI story hierarchy), decorators, and parameters. title should be unique, i.e. not re-used across files.

```js
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

export default {
  component: MyComponent,
  decorators: [ ... ],
  parameters: { ... },
  title: 'Path|To/MyComponent',
}
```

### Story Exports

By default every named export in the file represents a story function.

Story functions can be annotated with a story object to define story-level decorators and parameters, and also to define the name of the story.

The name is useful if you want to use names with spaces, names that correspond to restricted keywords in Javascript, or names that collide with other variables in the file. If it’s not specified, the export name will be used instead.

```js
export const simple = () => <MyComponent prop1={val1} />;

simple.story = {
  decorators: [ ... ],
  name: 'default', // can't be used as a named export
  parameters: { ... },
};
```

When you want to change the name of your story, just rename the CSF export. This will change the name of the story and also change the Story’s ID / URL.

You should use the `story.name` option in the following cases:

1. Want the name to show up in the Storybook UI in a way that’s not possible with a named export, e.g. reserved keywords like “default”, special characters like emoji, spacing/capitalization other than what’s provided by `storyNameFromExport`.

2. Want to preserve the Story ID independently from changing how it’s displayed. Having stable Story ID’s is useful for integration with third party tools.

### Non-story exports

In some cases, you may want to export a mixture of story and non-stories. For example., it can be useful to export data that’s used in your stories.

To make this possible, you can use optional `includeStories` and `excludeStories` configuration fields in the default export, which can be set to either an array of strings, or a regular expression.

Consider the following story file:

```js
import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
import someData from './data.json';

export default {
  component: MyComponent,
  includeStories: ['simpleStory', 'complexStory'],
  title: 'MyComponent',
};

export const simpleData = { foo: 1, bar: 'baz' };
export const complexData = { foo: 1, { bar: 'baz', baz: someData }};

export const simpleStory = () => <MyComponent data={simpleData} />;
export const complexStory = () => <MyComponent data={complexData} />;
```

When Storybook loads this file, it will see all the exports, but it will ignore the data exports and only treat simpleStory and complexStory as stories.

For this specific example the equivalent result can be achieved in a few ways depending on what’s convenient:

* `includeStories: ['simpleStory', 'complexStory']`

* `includeStories: /.*Story$/`

* `excludeStories: ['simpleData', 'complexData']`

* `excludeStories: /.*Data$/`

### Title

`Title` is computed from the component's `title`, and matches the component caption in Storybook's navigation.

For example:

```js
export default {
  title: 'Path/to/Badge',
};
```

### Subtitle

The `Subtitle` slot is computed from the component's `componentSubtitle` parameter.

For example in [Component Story Format (CSF)](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df):

```js
export default {
  ...
  parameters: {
    componentSubtitle: 'Handy status label',
  },
};
```

### Description

The `Description` slot is computed from the Component's docgen comments in the component's source.

For example, here's the source for `Badge`:

```js
/**
 * Use `Badge` to highlight key info with a predefined status.
 */
export const Badge = ({ status, children }) => { ... }
```

### Primary

The `Primary` slot is computed from the first user-defined story for the component.

For example here are `Badge`'s stories in CSF. The `allBadges` is selected as the primary story because it's first:

```js
// export default { ... }; /* Badge component metadata */
export const allBadges = () => ...
export const positive = () => ...
export const negative = () => ...
```

### Props

The `Props` slot is computed from the component's docgen props, which can be defined in typescript or using `react` PropTypes.

For example, here are the `PropTypes` for the `Badge` component

```js
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

// ... Badge definition ...

Badge.propTypes = {
  status: PropTypes.oneOf(['positive', 'negative', 'neutral', 'error', 'warning']),
};
Badge.defaultProps = {
  status: 'neutral',
};
```

### Stories

The `Stories` slot is computed from the user-defined stories for the component, excluding the first.

For example here are `Badge`'s stories in CSF. The `positive` and `negative` stories are selected in that order:

```js
// export default { ... }; /* Badge component metadata */
export const allBadges = () => ...
export const positive = () => ...
export const negative = () => ...
```
