# StoriesOf API

`storiesOf` is Storybook’s API for adding stories. Up until Storybook 5.2, it has been the primary way to create stories in Storybook.

In Storybook 5.2, a simpler and more portable Component Story Format was introduced, and all future tools and infrastructure will be oriented towards CSF.

A Storybook is a collection of stories. Each story represents a single visual state of a component.

Here’s a basic story file in the `storiesOf` API:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react';
import { action } from '@storybook/addon-actions';
import Button from '../components/Button';

storiesOf('Button', module)
  .add('with text', () => <Button onClick={action('clicked')}>Hello Button</Button>)
  .add('with some emoji', () => (
    <Button onClick={action('clicked')}>
      <span role="img" aria-label="so cool">
        😀 😎 👍 💯
      </span>
    </Button>
  ));
```

The string argument to storiesOf is the component title. If you pass a string like `'Widgets|Button/Button'` it can also be used to position your component’s story within Storybook’s story hierarchy.

Each `.add` call takes a story name, a story function that returns a renderable object (JSX in the case of React), and optionally some parameters, which are described below.
