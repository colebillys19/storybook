# Get Started

DMI Design System is a reusable component library that helps DMI contributors build UIs faster.

The goals is to make building durable UIs more productive and satisfying.

### Install

`npm i @dmi-storybook-design-system`

### Previewing Components

To search through the component explorer press the `/` key and enter the component name.

To the left of the page is the side panel with the component groups and their different states or stories.

The components are listed alphabetically on the side panel.

At the top of the side panel is the more icon with options and shortcuts.

Located at the top of the main view are the `Canvas` and `Docs` tabs along with a few design tools.

The Canvas tab is used to preview components while the Docs tabs displays information about the component api and usage.

#### Canvas

While in the Canvas the addon tabs `Knobs`, `Story`, `Actions`, and `Accessibility` will be below.

The `Knobs` tab is used to examine the component's appearance with alternate prop values.

The `Story` tab displays the code used to create the component.

The `Actions` displays action fired from the component such as onChange and onClick events.

#### Docs

The Docs tab displays a summary of the component, it's stories and props.

The components are displayed in a preview component and can be tested live.

The code used to compose the component can be displayed by clicking the `Show code` button on the bottom right.

The code can be copied by clicking the `copy` button when the code is shown.

There is also a props table displaying the prop types of the component along with a description and it's default value.

### Use

Import components you want into your UI.

`import { BasePaper } from '@dmi-storybook-design-system`

and use them like so

```js
const example = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('VALUE');

  const handleClick = (event) => {
    setValue('NEW VALUE');
  };

  return (
    <BasePaper
      onClick={handleClick}
      style={dmiStyles}
      value={value}
    >
      {value}
    </BasePaper>
  );
};
